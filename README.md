### Assignment1: Create a calculator

Issues:
  - trying to figure out how to get all the things to interact is funky
  - was having trouble getting the value from the input element rather than the element itself, found out I just had to add a '.value' to the end of the query
  - had to figure out that I needed to write the innerhtml in the javascript to get the output to output

### Assignment2: Create a gtihub gist of all coercions
