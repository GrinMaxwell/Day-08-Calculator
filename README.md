### Assignment1: Create a calculator

Issues:
  - feel like I have a huge leg up since I went to the first half of the crash course where we basically did this
  - trying to figure out how to get all the things to interact is funky
  - was having trouble getting the value from the input element rather than the element itself, found out I just had to add a '.value' to the end of the query
  - had to figure out that I needed to write the innerhtml in the javascript to get the output to output to the screen
  - having some difficulty getting the buttons to stay pressed and recognize that in the javascript
  - decided to just have a :focus css to show they were pressed and a variable in the javascript to contain what operator was pressed last

### Assignment2: Create a gtihub gist of all coercions

  - deciding to shoot for epic mode on this one
  - figured out how to use map to transform an array of coerced values pretty easily
  - having some trouble figuring out how to make the Javascript values jump into the table
  - asked Jess - it was a zero index issue! I needed to make it find the cell using i+1 rather than i
